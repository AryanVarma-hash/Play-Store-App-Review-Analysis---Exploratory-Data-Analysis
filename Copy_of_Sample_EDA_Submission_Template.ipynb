The User Reviews dataset adds deeper insights through translated reviews, sentiment labels, polarity scores, and subjectivity.\n",

The analysis revealed that most apps are free and targeted toward a broad audience (“Everyone”). Categories like Communication, Social, Tools, and Games dominate with the highest installs. Ratings mostly fall between 4.0–4.5, indicating generally good-quality apps. A strong correlation was observed between installs and the number of reviews, meaning popular apps naturally receive more feedback."
